- Use gentle, hand-drawn-style icons to represent different aspects of cow care and shelter activities.
- Maintain a clean, uncluttered layout with generous spacing to ensure readability and ease of navigation.
- Implement subtle animations, such as gentle fade-ins for images and content, to add a touch of visual appeal without being distracting.
