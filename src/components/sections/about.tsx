                In Vedic culture, the cow is revered as 'Gau Mata'â€”the universal mother. Serving her is the highest form of service. At Shri Gopal Krishna Gaushala, we are dedicated to this sacred principle of 'Gau Seva,' ensuring every cow receives the love, dignity, and care she deserves.

                Our Gaushala is more than a shelter; it is a sanctuary where mother cows, bulls, and calves are protected from neglect and slaughter. We rescue them from suffering and provide nutritious food, clean water, and a peaceful environment to live out their lives in tranquility. Our commitment is lifelong, ensuring they are always treated with the reverence and love befitting a mother.
